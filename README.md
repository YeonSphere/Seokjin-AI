# Seokjin-AI

A high-performance artificial intelligence system focused on unrestricted computation and maximum flexibility. Built with Zig, C, and Nim.

## Overview

Seokjin-AI is designed to push the boundaries of AI systems by prioritizing:

    Unrestricted computation capabilities
    Direct hardware access
    Maximum performance
    Flexible architecture
    Zero overhead abstractions

## Core Features

    Unrestricted Computation Engine: Direct access to system resources without artificial limitations
    Custom Memory Management: Zero-copy operations and direct memory control
    Hardware Acceleration: Native support for CPU/GPU optimization
    Flexible Architecture: Modular design allowing for easy expansion and modification
    Multi-language Integration: Seamless integration between Zig, C, and Nim components

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

    Zig (latest)
    C compiler (gcc/clang)
    Nim (latest)
    64-bit Linux system (preferred)
    At least 16GB RAM recommended

### Build Steps

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YeonSphere/Seokjin-AI.git
cd Seokjin-AI

# Build the project
zig build

# Run tests
zig build test

# Build with optimizations
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

## Usage

```zig
const ai = @import("seokjin");

pub fn main() !void {
    var system = try ai.init();
    defer system.deinit();

    // Configure system
    try system.configure(.{
        .memory_limit = null,  // Unrestricted memory usage
        .compute_mode = .unlimited,
        .hardware_access = .direct,
    });

    // Start processing
    try system.start();
}
```

## Performance Considerations

    No garbage collection
    Direct memory management
    Zero-copy operations
    Hardware-specific optimizations
    Minimal runtime overhead
